## Frame 2 — Meet Jobba

- scene: Brand name-drop resolves out of the pain beat; one-line promise lands under the wordmark
- voiceover: "Meet Jobba — upload your LinkedIn, it does the rest."
- duration: 3.179s
- transition_in: zoom-through
- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/02-meet-jobba.html
- type: product_intro
- persuasion: Negative contrast
- beat: relief
- blueprint: kinetic-type-beats (Reproduce — Product_Intro variant, `product-intro-kinetic-type-namedrop`)
- focal: assets/logo-69859b93.svg
- roles: logo-69859b93.svg = cutout (wordmark, centered, no backdrop image)
- sfx: pop, chime
- asset_candidates: assets/logo-69859b93.svg — Jobba/My Job Bucket brand mark

Reproduce: hard-cut through the name-drop and resolve on the brand mark, then a one-line promise types in beneath it — the namedrop shape extended with the promise as its second beat.

Scene 1 (0.0–1.27s): out of Frame 1's dark hold, "Meet" fades up small and centered above where the mark will land; a beat later the **Jobba** wordmark spring-pops to full size dead-center with a purple-to-pink gradient sweep across the letterforms that settles to solid purple (`spring-pop-entrance` + `gradient-text-sweep`) — Centered template, ~45% of frame.
Scene 2 (1.27–3.179s): as the VO says "upload your LinkedIn, it does the rest," a muted one-line promise types on beneath the wordmark, per-word staggered reveal timed to each phrase (`dynamic-content-sequencing`); once complete, both wordmark and line hold rock-still — a deliberate breather before the demo begins (no jitter, no drift).

narrativeRole: Lands the value claim (message) by beat 2, right after the pain — the reverse-iceberg turn.
keyMessage: One upload, Jobba handles everything downstream.

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# Gradient Text Sweep

Color that lives **inside the glyphs**: the headline's fill is an oversized gradient clipped into the letterforms (`background-clip: text`), and the motion is the gradient sliding **through** the type — the letters never move. Three forms: a **continuous sweep** across a held title card, a **word-to-word highlight** that lights a line left→right, and a **hue-sweep** that settles to a solid.

Boundaries: [asr-keyword-glow.md](asr-keyword-glow.md) is word-timed emphasis railed to ASR timestamps — this rule is a design beat with no audio rail. [ambient-glow-bloom.md](ambient-glow-bloom.md)'s traveling sweep is a sheen riding **over a surface**; here the gradient is masked **into the type** (its "Shimmer sweep" variation is this mechanism re-aimed as a working-state loop). [css-marker-patterns.md](css-marker-patterns.md) draws accents _around_ text, never fills.

## How It Works

The text carries a gradient background **wider than its own box** (`background-size: SWEEP_SPAN 100%`, e.g. `300% 100%`) clipped into the glyphs, so tweening `backgroundPosition` slides the gradient through the visible letterforms. Two gotchas own this rule:

- **`background-position` percentages only produce travel when `background-size` exceeds 100%** — at 100% the image is pinned and the tween is a silent no-op.
- **The percent axis runs opposite to the perceived travel** — tweening `"100% 50%"` → `"0% 50%"` moves the highlight left→right through the text.

1. **Continuous sweep (held title card)** — one long **linear** `backgroundPosition` tween spanning the hold. First and last color stops equal, so the travel has no visible seam and reads as endless while remaining a single finite tween.
2. **Word-to-word highlight** — each word is two pixel-identical stacked copies: a base copy in the resting color and a gradient-clipped copy at `opacity: 0`. A per-word opacity envelope (rise, then fall as the next word rises) passes the highlight along on an index-derived stagger — an **envelope, not a moving mask**: no per-word position measurement.
3. **Hue-sweep → solid** — the gradient holds position while a `filter: hue-rotate()` tween sweeps its hues; the settle is a stacked-copy crossfade to a solid twin — never a color-stop tween (gradients with different stops don't interpolate reliably).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<!-- Forms A/C: gradient headline; solid twin behind for the Form C settle -->
<div class="headline-stack">
  <h1 class="headline solid-twin">{headlineText}</h1>
  <h1 class="headline gradient-fill" id="headline">{headlineText}</h1>
</div>

<!-- Form B: per-word stacked copies -->
<p class="line">
  <span class="word"><span class="w-base">{word1}</span><span class="w-hot">{word1}</span></span>
  <span class="word"><span class="w-base">{word2}</span><span class="w-hot">{word2}</span></span>
</p>
```

```css
.headline-stack,
.word {
  display: grid; /* twins share one cell — pixel-identical boxes */
}
.headline,
.w-base,
.w-hot {
  grid-area: 1 / 1;
}
.gradient-fill,
.w-hot {
  background-image: {gradient}; /* {sweepGradient} A/C, {highlightGradient} B */
  background-size: SWEEP_SPAN 100%; /* MUST exceed 100% or the position tween is dead */
  background-position: 100% 50%; /* start; tween toward 0% for left→right travel */
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  background-clip: text;
  color: transparent;
}
.solid-twin {
  color: {settleColor};
}
.w-base {
  color: {restColor};
}
.w-hot {
  opacity: 0; /* the envelope raises it as the highlight passes */
}
```

```js
// Form A: continuous sweep. 100% → 0% reads left→right (percent axis inverted);
// ease "none" — an eased sweep reads as an object, not light.
tl.fromTo(
  "#headline",
  { backgroundPosition: "100% 50%" },
  { backgroundPosition: "0% 50%", duration: SWEEP_DUR, ease: "none" },
  SWEEP_START,
);

// Form B: traveling highlight — per-word rise/fall envelopes, index stagger.
gsap.utils.toArray(".w-hot").forEach((el, i) => {
  const at = HIGHLIGHT_START + i * WORD_LAG;
  tl.fromTo(el, { opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1, duration: HOT_RISE, ease: "power2.out" }, at);
  tl.to(el, { opacity: 0, duration: HOT_FALL, ease: "power2.in" }, at + WORD_LAG);
});

// Form C: hue-sweep, then crossfade to the solid twin (never tween color stops).
tl.fromTo(
  "#headline",
  { filter: "hue-rotate(0deg)" },
  { filter: `hue-rotate(${HUE_RANGE}deg)`, duration: HUE_DUR, ease: "power1.inOut" },
  HUE_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#headline",
  { opacity: 0, duration: SETTLE_SNAP_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  HUE_START + HUE_DUR,
);
```

## Variations

- **Title-card crawl** — Form A stretched across a long terminal hold (3–8s end card): seamless-ended gradient, `ease: "none"`, `SWEEP_DUR` = the whole hold. One tween, no loop.
- **One-pass sheen inside type** — gradient is the resting fill everywhere except one narrow highlight band (≤ ~25% of the span); one `backgroundPosition` pass carries the band through and the text returns to rest with no crossfade.
- **Karaoke settle** — Form B with the fall tweens skipped: the line lights cumulatively left→right and holds fully lit; settle color = the hot state, base copies start dimmer.
- **Gradient climax word** — one emphasized word (often ~-8° rotated) carries the gradient while the line stays solid; static gradient + a short Form C hue shift on landing, settling to the brand accent. Pairs with a `kinetic-beat-slam` arrival.

| SWEEP_DUR           | 1.2–3s                 | match the card's hold exactly; slower than ~4s stops registering as motion           |
| WORD_LAG            | 0.25–0.5s              | HOT_FALL starts exactly WORD_LAG after the rise so envelopes cross — a gap = a blink |
| HOT_RISE / HOT_FALL | 0.15–0.3s / 0.25–0.45s | fall slightly longer — the highlight "trails"                                        |
| HUE_RANGE / HUE_DUR | 40–180° / 0.8–1.6s     | past ~180° the palette dissociates from itself mid-sweep                             |
| SETTLE_SNAP_DUR     | 0.1–0.35s              | the goldens snap (~0.15s)                                                            |
| {settleColor}       | —                      | one of the gradient's own stops (or the brand ink) so the settle reads as resolution |

## Critical Constraints

- **`background-size` > 100%** on any element whose `backgroundPosition` is tweened — otherwise the tween is a silent no-op.
- **Percent axis is inverted** — left→right perceived travel is `100% → 0%`.
- **Both `-webkit-background-clip: text` AND `background-clip: text`, with `color: transparent`** — missing the prefix renders a solid gradient block over the text in the capture browser.
- **`ease: "none"` on position sweeps** — this is supposed to read as light, not an accelerating object.
- **Seamless ends for a crawl** — first and last stops equal, or the wrap point flashes a hard edge mid-hold.
- **Stacked copies pixel-identical** — same box, font, weight, tracking, one grid cell; any metric drift makes the crossfade a double-exposure.
- **`data-layout-allow-occlusion` on the twin** — pixel-identical stacked copies trip `hyperframes check`'s `text_occluded` gate by construction; the flag is the sanctioned waiver for this mechanism.
- **Settle by crossfade, never by tweening stops**; and the glyphs never move — if the type must travel, that's a separate rule on the wrapper.
- **No CSS `@keyframes` shimmer** — wall-clock animation desyncs from seek; every sweep is a timeline tween.

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="pop-hero" id="hero">{heroLabel}</div>

<div class="pop-grid">
  <div class="pop-item">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

| POP_DUR    | 0.4–0.7s                                  | shorter = tight snap; hero must be visible by **t ≤ 0.5s**       |
| STAGGER    | 0.04–0.08s                                | `min(0.06, 0.5 / ITEM_COUNT)` — self-caps the window             |
| ITEM_COUNT | 3–9                                       | >9 makes the stagger vanish — switch to a wipe/sweep reveal      |
| Y_RISE     | 0–32px                                    | small; never large enough to read as a slide-up                  |
| ROT_FROM   | −10°–+10°                                 | playful variant only; alternate sign by index (`i % 2 ? 6 : -6`) |
| ENTRY_AT   | 0–0.4s                                    | a beat of quiet, but keep the subject landing by t ≤ 0.5s        |

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.
