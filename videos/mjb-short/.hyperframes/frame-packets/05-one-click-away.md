- sfx: click, chime
- asset_candidates: assets/logo-69859b93.svg — Jobba/My Job Bucket brand mark

Reproduce: hero mark holds, condenses into the CTA, a cursor arrives and presses it — the blueprint's shape unchanged, cast with the Jobba wordmark and a "Try Jobba Free" pill.

Scene 1 (0.0–0.7s): the Jobba wordmark holds dead-center on the near-black canvas, alive but resting — only a faint rotational breath — as the VO says "Your next job is one click away." Camera static.
Scene 2 (0.7–1.3s): the wordmark CONDENSES at the same center into a smaller, brighter purple "Try Jobba Free" pill button — outgoing mark shrink-fades exactly as the pill scales up in its place, one shared transform-origin (`scale-swap-transition`).
Scene 3 (1.3–1.9s): a simple custom cursor arrives from off-stage on a decelerating path and lands a few px off the pill's geometric center, reading human, not scripted.
Scene 4 (1.9–3.179s): as the VO lands "Try Jobba free," the cursor presses — cursor and pill compress together in lockstep, then release with a soft purple glow bloom (`physics-press-reaction` + `ambient-glow-bloom`); the URL myjobbucket.com settles beneath the pill; holds dead static to the final frame.

narrativeRole: Closes on the free, low-friction action — no reason left not to click.
keyMessage: Getting started costs nothing and takes one click.

# Ambient Glow Bloom

A soft radial glow that **blooms in behind a hero element** (card, logo, metric) and holds, giving it presence. Unlike `press-release-spring`'s click-triggered burst or `asr-keyword-glow`'s word-timed envelope, this glow is **un-triggered** — it blooms on the hero's settle and stays lit. Two forms: a **hero bloom** that swells behind a settling element then breathes, and a **traveling sweep** that translates a soft highlight across a surface exactly once.

## How It Works

A radial-gradient layer sits **behind** the hero (glow `z-index: 1`, hero `z-index: 2` — a glow in front occludes it), starting at `opacity: 0`. Over the bloom-in window it ramps `opacity: 0 → peak` with a gentle `scale` swell, timed so `BLOOM_START + BLOOM_DUR` lands on the hero's settle — glow and hero resolve as ONE beat ("powering on"), never glow-then-card. After bloom-in:

1. **Hero bloom** — a **bounded idle breathe** during the hold: a finite `ease: "none"` tween advances a `phase` proxy and `onUpdate` nudges opacity + scale a hair around peak (never a `yoyo` loop). `sin(0) = 0` → the breathe starts exactly at the bloom's resting state.
2. **Traveling sweep** — a narrow highlight band at one edge translates **once** across to the other (`x` off-surface to off-surface), clipped to the surface (`overflow: hidden`). One pass, no return — a repeating sweep reads as a loading shimmer, not a reveal accent (the shimmer-sweep variation below is the sanctioned exception).

Peak opacity stays restrained (**≤ 0.45 hard ceiling**) so the glow gives presence without washing the frame; the glow color is **darker + more saturated** than the element it backs (a same-hue, same-lightness glow disappears into the surface).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<div class="bloom-stage">
  <div class="bloom-glow" id="bloom-glow"></div>
  <!-- z-index: 1; inset: GLOW_INSET (negative); background: {glowGradient} -->
  <div class="hero-card" id="hero-card">{HeroLabel}</div>
  <!-- z-index: 2 -->
</div>
<!-- sweep form: <div class="sweep" id="sweep"> inside the overflow:hidden surface -->
```

```js
// ── Form A: HERO BLOOM ── bloom in soft, landing on the hero's settle.
tl.fromTo(
  "#bloom-glow",
  { opacity: 0, scale: GLOW_START_SCALE },
  { opacity: GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY, scale: 1, duration: BLOOM_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  BLOOM_START,
);
// Bounded breathe during the hold — finite phase tween, NOT a yoyo loop.
const glow = document.getElementById("bloom-glow");
const phase = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  phase,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BREATHE_CYCLES,
    duration: BREATHE_DUR,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const s = Math.sin(phase.p);
      glow.style.opacity = String(GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY + s * OPACITY_AMP);
      glow.style.transform = `scale(${1 + s * SCALE_AMP})`;
    },
  },
  BLOOM_START + BLOOM_DUR,
);

// ── Form B: TRAVELING SWEEP ── one finite pass, constant glide.
tl.fromTo(
  "#sweep",
  { x: SWEEP_START_X, opacity: 0 },
  { x: SWEEP_END_X, opacity: SWEEP_PEAK_OPACITY, duration: SWEEP_DUR, ease: "none" },
  SWEEP_START,
);
tl.to("#sweep", { opacity: 0, duration: SWEEP_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.in" }, SWEEP_FADE_START);
```

## Variations

- **Bloom-and-hold** — for scenes <3s or a hero with its own idle, skip the breathe: the single `fromTo` is the whole recipe.
- **Pulse-on-arrival** — bloom slightly PAST peak (`GLOW_OVERSHOOT_OPACITY`, `scale: 1.06`), then a second adjacent tween eases down to a steady hold — one breath punctuating the landing, no ongoing loop.
- **Multi-hero relay** — stagger per-glow `BLOOM_START` by ~0.15–0.3s across a row; shrink `OPACITY_AMP` / `SCALE_AMP` per the `/√N` rule below.
- **Diagonal raked sweep** — angle `{sweepGradient}` (~105°) across a wordmark: the classic one-pass logo sheen. Narrower `SWEEP_WIDTH`, higher `SWEEP_PEAK_OPACITY`.

### Shimmer sweep (text-clipped status-phrase working-state)

The sweep re-aimed **inside type**: a soft highlight gradient clipped into a status phrase ("Thinking…", "Analyzing dataset…") via `background-clip: text` travels left→right through the letterforms — the grey-on-grey shimmer that says _still working_. Unlike every other form here it legitimately **repeats while the status is live**: the repetition is diegetic working-state, not idle wobble (same defense as a blinking caret — the motion performs status). Two things keep it honest: it is **bounded** (one finite tween whose pass count is computed from the status window, never `repeat: -1`), and it is **killed at resolve** — the moment the status completes, the shimmer stops dead; a shimmer surviving into the answer beat turns a working indicator into decoration.

```js
// Status shimmer — N passes as ONE bounded tween. Killed at resolve.
const status = document.getElementById("status-phrase");
// CSS on #status-phrase: background: {shimmerGradient}; background-size: 300% 100%;
// -webkit-background-clip: text; background-clip: text; color: transparent;
const shimmer = { p: 0 };
const PASSES = Math.round(STATUS_DUR / PASS_PERIOD); // whole passes, computed up front
tl.to(
  shimmer,
  {
    p: PASSES,
    duration: STATUS_DUR,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const t = shimmer.p % 1; // 0→1 within each pass; percent axis inverted → left→right travel
      status.style.backgroundPosition = `${(1 - t) * 100}% 50%`;
    },
  },
  STATUS_START,
);
tl.set(status, { backgroundPosition: "100% 50%" }, STATUS_START + STATUS_DUR); // resolve: dead.
```

Keep it a whisper: `{shimmerGradient}` is the status text's own grey with one slightly-lighter band (highlight stop a step above the base, nothing near white); `background-size` ~300% keeps the band narrow in the glyphs; `PASS_PERIOD` 1.2–1.8s — slower reads as a sheen accent, faster as a spinner. Whole-number `PASSES` lands the band at its start position exactly at the kill frame, so the `tl.set` is visually a no-op. This is the working-state cousin of `gradient-text-sweep`: reach **here** when the sweep _means_ "in progress," **there** when the gradient is the typographic treatment itself.

## Critical Constraints

- **Glow peak opacity ≤ 0.45** — including breathe amplitude; default to the LOW end (0.15–0.30).
- **Glow behind, hero in front**; glow color darker + more saturated than the hero surface.
- **Land glow and hero as one beat** — before or after reads as two separate events.
- **Breathe is bounded, sweep is one pass** — the only sanctioned repetition is the shimmer sweep, bounded and killed at resolve.
- **Concurrent halos compound** — per-glow amps ≤ default `/√N`, stagger breathe periods (2.6s / 2.9s / 3.3s) so they don't pulse in lockstep.
- **Don't combine a `boxShadow` glow on the hero with this halo layer** — they compete and read muddy; the glow lives on the dedicated layer.

# Physics Press Reaction (Cursor + Element Synced)

Models a real click: a cursor approaches a button, lands, and both compress IN SYNC, then release together. Distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (no cursor — just a press happening); this rule is the COMBINED cursor + element behavior. A single `PRESS_INTENSITY` drives both: press down compresses both to `1 - PRESS_INTENSITY` via **one targets array**, release springs both back to 1.0 with overshoot. The cursor translates to the button's center BEFORE the press starts; after release it may move on or hold.

## Recipe

```html
<button class="btn" id="btn">{ctaCopy}</button>
<!-- Cursor at scene-root level so it translates freely; arrow TIP is the click
     point, so transform-origin: 0 0 — scaling around the tip keeps it stable. -->
<svg class="cursor" id="cursor" style="pointer-events: none; transform-origin: 0 0">…</svg>
```

```js
gsap.set("#cursor", { x: CURSOR_START_X, y: CURSOR_START_Y }); // off-screen / far corner

// Phase 1 — approach
tl.to(
  "#cursor",
  { x: BUTTON_CENTER_X, y: BUTTON_CENTER_Y, duration: APPROACH_DUR, ease: "power2.inOut" },
  APPROACH_START,
);

// Phase 2 — coordinated press down: ONE targets array, same scale
tl.to(
  ["#btn", "#cursor"],
  { scale: 1 - PRESS_INTENSITY, duration: PRESS_DOWN_DUR, ease: "power1.in" },
  PRESS_DOWN_AT,
);

// Phase 3 — release: both spring back together
tl.to(
  ["#btn", "#cursor"],
  { scale: 1, duration: RELEASE_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  RELEASE_AT,
);

// Phase 4 — inner glow during press, resting shadow on release (contact confirmation)
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  { boxShadow: "{btnPressedShadow}", duration: PRESS_DOWN_DUR, ease: "power1.in" },
  PRESS_DOWN_AT,
);
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  { boxShadow: "{btnRestingShadow}", duration: RELEASE_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  RELEASE_AT,
);

// Cursor optionally exits after the press settles
tl.to(
  "#cursor",
  { x: CURSOR_EXIT_X, y: CURSOR_EXIT_Y, duration: CURSOR_EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  CURSOR_EXIT_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Multiple-element chain press** — press button A → A triggers a swap → cursor moves to button B → presses again; each press is one full down-release sub-routine.
- **Hold press (continuous pressure)** — insert a `HOLD_DUR` window between press-down and release: both scales stay at `1 - PRESS_INTENSITY`, inner glow stays on. Suggests "thinking" or "loading."
- **Synchronized inner-glow pulse** — during the hold, pulse the inset glow with a sine driver: a `{ p: 0 }` proxy tweened to `Math.PI * GLOW_PULSE_CYCLES * 2` on `ease: "none"`, `onUpdate` writing `boxShadow` with `alpha = GLOW_BASE_ALPHA + sin(p) * GLOW_PULSE_AMP`. Suggests "processing."

## Critical Constraints

- **Same press scale on cursor AND button** (one targets array) — only the button scaling makes the cursor "tap on air"; only the cursor scaling makes the button feel disconnected.
- **Cursor arrives BEFORE the press starts** — a clear "cursor over target" moment, or the press is unattributed.
- **`back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` on the release, for both together** — a linear release loses the tactile feel; release MUST come after press.
- **Inner glow appears DURING press, fades on release** — outer shadow shrinks (pushed in), inner glow appears (energy concentrated).
- **Cursor `transform-origin: 0 0`** — the arrow's tip is the click point; scale around the tip keeps it stable. `pointer-events: none` on the cursor.
- **Climax dwell ≥ 1 s** — after release the composition must continue ≥ 1 s; the press is a beat, the viewer needs time to see the result.
- **No real `mouseenter` / `click` events** — HF is a render context; everything runs via the timeline.

## Selected motion rule: scale-swap-transition

---
name: scale-swap-transition
description: Coordinated shrink-out + spring pop-in morph-like transition between two elements — no SVG path interpolation needed.
metadata:
  tags: transition, morph, scale, swap, spring, pop
---

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.
